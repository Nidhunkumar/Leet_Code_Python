'''Consecutive zeros
The goal of this challenge is to analyze a binary string consisting of only zeros and ones. Your code should find the biggest number of consecutive zeros in the string. For example, given the string:

"1001101000110"
The biggest number of consecutive zeros is 3.

Define a function named consecutive_zeros that takes a single parameter, which is the string of zeros and ones. Your function should return the number described above.'''

a="1001101000110"
l=a.split("1")
#print(l)
mx=l[0]
for i in range(len(a.split("1"))):
    if mx< l[i]:
        mx =l[i]
print(len(mx))     
        
# naive solution
def consecutive_zeros(bin_str):
    result = 0
    streak = 0
    for letter in bin_str:
        if letter == "0":
            streak += 1
        else:
            streak = 0
        result = max(result, streak)
    return result

# shorter solution
def consecutive_zeros(bin_str):
    return max([len(s) for s in bin_str.split("1")])
